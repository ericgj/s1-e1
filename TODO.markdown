## TODO

- Draft integration tests, create dummy Twitter::JSONStream.connect and EventMachine::HttpRequest#get instead of hitting Twitter and YMLP
- Integration testing now that auth is loaded from config files
- Test Twitter::ReplyClient
- Test Environment::Twitter when access token/secret not already saved
- Debug why unparseable and unaddressed commands are not being captured properly
