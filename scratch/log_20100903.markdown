## Basic design plan

The primary library used to read incoming commands is twitter-stream via the Twitter Streaming API.  Twitter-stream runs within an EventMachine loop, and within that loop I have a HTTP client processing commands against YMLP, and another HTTP client writing results via the Twitter REST API (as direct messages).

## Development round 1

Some basic questions have to be answered -

1. Can I get the EM HTTP client working against YMLP?
2. Can I get the EM HTTP client working against Twitter?
